## 1. YouTube's Copyright Policy
YouTube detects copyrighted content through automated systems like Content ID, which scans uploads against a database of copyrighted audio and video, and through tools like the Copyright Match Tool and manual copyright removal requests submitted via webform. When a video is flagged, the copyright owner can choose to block it, monetize it (earning ad revenue), or track it, and manual takedowns result in copyright strikes. Creators can respond by filing a dispute, then an appeal if needed, and if their video is removed, they may submit a counter-notification to request reinstatement. Monetization of claimed content is allowed, but revenue usually goes to the rights holder unless they allow sharing. YouTube also offers special programs for rights holders, including Content ID licensing, the Copyright Match Tool, and formal takedown-request systems.

## Content Created:

### 2. Fairuse Experiment:
For the fairuse experiment, I simple got snippets of 5 seconds and 1 minute of the song "Alesis" by mk.gee. I uploaded them both to YouTube. 

### 3. AI-generated Content
I used Suno for this portion. One of the first things I attempted was to simply "create a song in the style of Kendrick Lamar. Take inspiration from his most popular songs like 'Not Like Us', 'Alright', 'Money Trees,' etc.". That attempt was immediately stopped with this message:

I then attempted to create a piece of music similar to that of my favorite artists but not mentioning his name at all. I simply described how his music sounded like and attempted to make it as close as possible to the product of mk.gee. It outputted something, but not really what I was thinking. The prompt was: "make a solemn song with a guitar that sounds like it has strong pedals put on top of it. i want it to be a nighttime vibe and have the guitar be the main focus. i want the song to be very textured, with effected drums and other random instrumental musical sounds layered on top of it"
This is what it outputted:

### Outcome:

Immediately, I got a message saying that the 1 minute video of Alesis was flagged for copyrighted material, but it was not taken down and it won't affect my channel. The other two videos that were uploaded were not affected.

## 4. Legal Analysis
For both the 5-second and 30-second uploads of “Alesis,” the fair use factors weigh mostly against the use: the clips were non-transformative, taken from a highly creative song, and used without commentary or analysis. The short length of the 5-second clip slightly helps under the “amount used” factor, but even brief excerpts can still be considered the core of a song. The 1 minute clip weighs even more strongly against fair use because it uses a more substantial portion. Neither upload was commercial or likely to harm the market for the original, but overall neither would qualify as fair use under a traditional legal analysis.

However, YouTube’s enforcement behavior shows a clear gap between copyright law and real platform practice. Even though the fair use analysis is weak, YouTube did not remove the uploads; instead, Content ID simply claimed the video and redirected monetization. This reflects how platforms rely on automated matching systems rather than fair use reasoning and often allow non-transformative uses to remain online as long as rights holders can monetize them. In contrast, Suno blocked direct imitation of Kendrick Lamar at the creation stage, showing stricter preventive controls than YouTube’s upload enforcement. These differences highlight how platform policies and automated systems shape real outcomes more than the legal standards themselves.
